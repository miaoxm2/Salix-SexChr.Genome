### **3-1 phylogeny construction**

1. A maximum likelihood tree for each Z-W homologous gene was built using IQ-TREE with the best model and partition scheme selected by ModelFinder.
2. Phylogeny tree of S. herbacea and eight other Salix species, two Populus species were constructed.

### **3-2 Synteny analysis with other _Salix_ species**
1. We performed pairwise genome alignments between the two haplotypes of Salix herbacea and two published Salix genomes using Minimap2 v2.24.

### **3-3 Evolutionary history of genes with sex-specific variation**
1. The gene multiple synteny plots were generated using MCScan (python version) under JCVI.
2. We identified whether the female-specific sites (INDELs) and female-specific single-nucleotide variants (SNPs) were also present in other Salix species.

### **3-4 Candidate sex determination genes**
1. All the sex-linked genes and candidate sex determination genes in _S. herbacea_ were searched in other available _Salix_ and _Populus_ genome assemblies.
